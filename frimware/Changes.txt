v0.4.1:
- Fixed a problem with EEPROM_WriteString
- M112 (Shutdown) now displays a message on the LCD
- Cartesian parameters are now fetched later during g-code processing and only if necessary. This fixes some issues with multiple g-code commands on one line.

v0.4:
- G-code processor now handles multiple G commands per line (currently up to 5), TODO: The G-codes on one line are currently executed in the same order they're found in the line.
- Drill cycles G81, G82, G83, G85, G89 and G73 added
- Added Set Zero XY and Set Zero Z commands to GUI
- Experimental EaseIn/EaseOut code for cartesian_dda
- M6 command: Tool change (manual)
- G54..G59 Working Coordinate System (WCS)
- EEPROM preferences for WCS and Tools


TODO:
- Pause machine in case of an error (e.g. unsuccessful G54 command)
- Reenable/Reinsert Extruder code
- G40/G41/G42
- Automatic delayed homing after machine reset
